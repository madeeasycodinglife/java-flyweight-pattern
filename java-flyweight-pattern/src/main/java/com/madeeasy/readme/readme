**Java Flyweight Pattern: Efficiently Sharing Common Data**

The Flyweight Design Pattern is used to minimize memory usage and improve performance by sharing objects that have
 similar characteristics. It focuses on conserving memory by reusing existing objects rather than creating new ones.

**Example:**

Here's an example of a flyweight pattern in Java that represents different types of trees with shared intrinsic attributes:


         TreeType (Oak, Green)
           /                   \
  Oak Tree (10, 20)       Oak Tree (15, 25)

         TreeType (Pine, Brown)
           /                   \
 Pine Tree (30, 40)      Pine Tree (35, 45)


```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

// Flyweight Interface
interface Tree {
    void display(int x, int y);
}

// Concrete Flyweight (TreeType)
class TreeType implements Tree {
    private String name;
    private String color;

    public TreeType(String name, String color) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
    }

    @Override
    public void display(int x, int y) {
        System.out.println("Drawing " + name + " tree at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with color " + color);
    }
}

// Flyweight Factory
class TreeFactory {
    private Map<String, TreeType> treeTypes = new HashMap<>();

    public TreeType getTreeType(String name, String color) {
        TreeType treeType = treeTypes.get(name);
        if (treeType == null) {
            treeType = new TreeType(name, color);
            treeTypes.put(name, treeType);
        }
        return treeType;
    }
}

// Client Code
public class FlyweightExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeFactory treeFactory = new TreeFactory();

        TreeType oakTree = treeFactory.getTreeType("Oak", "Green");
        TreeType pineTree = treeFactory.getTreeType("Pine", "Brown");

        oakTree.display(10, 20);
        pineTree.display(30, 40);
    }
}
```

**How to Identify When to Apply the Flyweight Design Pattern:**

1. **Shared State:** When you have many similar objects that share common intrinsic (invariant) data but differ in extrinsic (variant) data.

2. **Memory Optimization:** If memory usage is a concern and you want to avoid creating a large number of similar objects.

3. **Performance Improvement:** When you want to improve performance by reusing objects and reducing object creation overhead.

**Where to Apply the Flyweight Design Pattern:**

- **Graphical User Interfaces:** In UI frameworks, sharing graphical elements with similar attributes to conserve memory.

- **Text Processing:** Reusing font objects with common attributes like font size and style.

- **Game Development:** Sharing sprite or texture objects in games to improve rendering performance.

- **Database Connection Pools:** Reusing database connections to minimize overhead.

- **Tokenization:** When parsing text, sharing token objects with common attributes to optimize memory usage.

By applying the Flyweight Design Pattern, you can achieve efficient memory utilization by sharing common data among multiple
objects, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory consumption.
